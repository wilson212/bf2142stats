Stats in Battlefield 2142 are slightly different than they were in Battlefield 2.

One thing that was done in Battlefield 2142 was to introduce a semi-unique authentication token. This token is used to try to differentiate game users from folks running stats sites, who try to pull thousands of players stats at once. If you have or plan on running a big stats site, please take into consideration (as it will affect the in game experience for all of us) that when you do this, it will degrade performance of everyone in game who's stats need to be updated (both the server pushing the stat info, and the user trying to view it in BFHQ). Anyone implementing this needs to use a very smart and non-aggressive pulling mechanism.

GameSpy / IGN is doing a fairly good job at blocking people's IP Addresses who incorrectly access their stats servers (so proceed with caution). If this does happen to you (the IP you play bf2142 from gets blocked), your stats in game will still be updated, and you should be able to access them once you join a ranked server.
