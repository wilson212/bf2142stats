Hi there! This is a Python implementation of EA's Battlefield 2142 stats queries.

The easiest usage is create an instance of ea.rpc.StatsWrapper with (your) PID
and call it's public functions.

If you wish, you can go deeper: use ea.auth.make_auth token generator and
query servers by yourself.

The ea.aes and ea.crc modules containing some tricky tables and functions to
compute AES and CRC16-CCITT data, used in creation of auth token.

Fully implemented wrappers
==========================

So far:
  get_awards(pid)
  get_backend_info()
  player_search(nick)
  player_info(mode)
  get_leader_board(self, pos, after, mode, **kwargs)
  make get_unlocks_info
    
Remaining
=========

get_unlocks_info is lacking mode table as i can't work it out because of
"E 999 $ 4 $" response from server.

Note of warning
===============
                 PLEASE VERIFY YOUR DATA BEFORE FEEDING IT TO FUNCs!
  THERE ARE RISK OF BEING BANNED FOR INCORRECT OR UNPOLITE (ab)USAGE OF STATS.

   PLEASE READ ALL MATERIALS ON THIS TOPIC BEFORE USING THIS or that MODULES
